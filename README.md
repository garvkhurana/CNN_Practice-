Dog and Cat Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Introduction
Welcome to the Dog and Cat Classification project using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This repository contains code for building, training, and evaluating a CNN model to classify images as either dogs or cats.

Dataset
The dataset consists of the following components:

x_train.npy: Training set images represented as numpy arrays.
y_train.npy: Labels corresponding to the training set images, indicating whether each image is a dog or a cat.
Files
model.py: Implementation of the CNN model architecture.
train.py: Script to train the CNN model on the provided dataset.
evaluate.py: Script to evaluate the trained model's performance on a separate test set.
requirements.txt: List of required Python packages. Install them using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure Python is installed on your system.
Install required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Place your dataset files (x_train.npy and y_train.npy) in the project directory.
Training the Model
Run train.py to train the CNN model.
Copy code
python train.py
The trained model will be saved as CNN_dog_and_cat_classifier.h5.
Evaluating the Model
After training, evaluate the model's performance on a separate test set.
Provide the path to your test data and labels.
css
Copy code
python evaluate.py --test_data <path_to_test_data> --test_labels <path_to_test_labels>
The script will output evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Additional Notes
Experiment with different CNN architectures and hyperparameters to improve model performance.
Consider data augmentation techniques to increase training data diversity and prevent overfitting.
Visualize the training process and model predictions for insights into model behavior.
